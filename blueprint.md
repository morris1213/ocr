# Project Blueprint: AI-Powered OCR

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) web application. It allows users to upload an image, and the application will extract and display the text from the image. The application is built with Next.js and utilizes the Tesseract.js library for OCR functionality.

## Design and Features

### Implemented (V1):

*   **UI/UX:**
    *   Modern, dark-themed interface with a gradient background.
    *   Responsive layout for various screen sizes.
    *   Interactive file upload area with a preview of the selected image.
    *   Clear and visually appealing typography.
    *   Animated buttons and transitions for a smoother user experience.
    *   Language selection dropdown to improve OCR accuracy for different languages.
    *   Binarization checkbox for advanced image pre-processing.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Image upload functionality (PNG, JPG, GIF).
    *   Client-side OCR using Tesseract.js.
    *   Display of extracted text.
    *   Loading state to indicate when OCR is in progress.
    *   Error handling and logging for the OCR process.
    *   Image pre-processing (grayscale and contrast adjustment) for enhanced OCR accuracy using the HTML5 Canvas API.
    *   Advanced image pre-processing with binarization to improve OCR accuracy for challenging images.
    *   Multi-language support for OCR, including English, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, French, and German.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Configured for static export, making it compatible with Cloudflare Pages.

## Plan for Current Request

*   **Task:** Configure the project for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

*   **Steps:**
    1.  **[Completed]** Created a `next.config.js` file.
    2.  **[Completed]** In `next.config.js`, set the `output` property to `'export'` to enable static site generation.
    3.  **[Completed]** Updated the `blueprint.md` file to document the deployment configuration.
